TextBooked Project SRS Evaluation
=================================

Nice job on this, a very good document.

This is fairly complete, good coverage of the basic requirements.  One
thing to note, try to specify things more completely in some areas.  For
example, in requirement 5.2.1.2.3, what publishing information will be
provided?  In requirement 5.2.1.2.4, what condition selections are going
to be supported?  In requirement 5.2.2.3.1, what information will be in
the manual entry form?  All these things should be specified in the
document, so that the person *building* the application knows what to
put *into* the application

These are "philosophy of requirements" issues that you can apply in a
*general* way to nearly all the requirements in the document.  However,
in the essence of time remaining, I'm assigning full credit to this
deliverable, for both the initial and the final submissions.

You don't have to do anything further with this document if you don't
feel the need to do so.

Deliverable D-02: 15% out of 15% = 100% which is an A-plus
Deliverable D-05:  5% out of  5% = 100% which is an A-plus

Keep up the good work!
