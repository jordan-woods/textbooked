# 2.0 Preliminary Project Proposals

## TextBooked

TextBooked is a student to student textbook buying and selling application. At first, the application will be specific to Loyola Marymount University students. LMU students will be able to post a book that they are selling with information such as condition, teacher, class, and price. Other students will be able to go to the application and view all books that are being sold as well as search for books that they would like to purchase. Once they have found a book they would like to purchase, they can tell the original poster that they are interested and the two can meet up on campus to do the exchange. The application will be built using Swift and iOS.
