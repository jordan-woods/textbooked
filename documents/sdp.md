# 4 TextBooked Software Development Plan
## 4.1 Plan Introduction

This Software Development Plan provides the details of the planned development for the TextBooked iOS application which facilitates the buying and selling of textbooks on college campuses.     

In the TextBooked application, users can post books that they are looking to sell. They will be prompted to specify information such as book price and quality. Users can also search for textbooks they would like to purchase from sellers. The application is meant to ease the process of finding a textbook from another student on campus. Textbook transactions between students are usually cheaper than purchasing that same book from Amazon or similar sites. TextBooked also allows students to get rid of the clutter of old textbooks.

By 3/05, the the frontend will be implemented using Swift. By 3/19, Firebase will be setup and integrated into TextBooked, as well as the login functionality. By 4/02 the frontend will populate with data. The last month of the semester will be spend tying up loose ends for the project, allowing me to complete the project to my maximum ability.
